class one_against_rest(object):
    '''
    Implements one vs. rest classification strategy to transform
    a binary classifier into a multi-class classifier.

    classifier = one_against_rest(base)

    base must be a callable object that provides the base classifier to use.

    Example
    -------

    multi = one_against_rest(milk.supervised.simple_svm)
    multi.train(training_features,labels)
    print multi.apply(testing_features)

    We are using a class as a base, but we can use any callable object:

    multi = one_against_rest(lambda : milk.supervised.tree(purity_measure='gini'))
    ...
